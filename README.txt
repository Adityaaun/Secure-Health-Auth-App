## Key Security Features

* **ðŸ”’ Adaptive Multi-Factor Authentication:** Prompts for 2FA only for new/untrusted devices or in response to suspicious behavior.
* ** Biometric Session Monitoring:** Continuously authenticates a doctor's session by analyzing keyboard and mouse dynamics, locking the session if behavior deviates.
* **ðŸ”‘ Secure Registration & Login:** Enforces strong passwords and prevents the use of passwords exposed in known data breaches.
* **ðŸ‘® Real-Time Admin Dashboard:** Provides administrators with a live feed of security events, audit logs, and interactive controls to disable users or terminate sessions.
* **ðŸš¨ Emergency "Break Glass" Access:** Allows doctors to access records of patients not under their direct care in emergencies, with every action logged for audit.

## Tech Stack

* **Frontend:** React, TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS
* **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js
* **Database:** MongoDB with Mongoose
* **Real-time Communication:** Socket.IO
* **Security Libraries:** bcrypt, JWT, Speakeasy (for 2FA)
